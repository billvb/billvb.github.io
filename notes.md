## Notes

### Welcome

I now receive many messages from the monthly Hacker News _"Who is Hiring"_/_"Who Wants to be Hired"_ posts.
I find these to be an excellent way of making connections.
If you came here via HN - welcome!

I made this page to give a little more information about my background, objectives, and approaches.


### Intended Roles and Functions

I tend to seek positions at organizations that emphasize the following, as they tend to play to my strengths and foster my initiative.

 _Multi-disciplinary, broadly-scoped roles over narrow ones._

Over my career I've worn a number of hats, from being a product manager for an airspace management system, a lead Python back-end developer for a data science start-up, a product QA/V&amp;V team lead, an embedded software engineer working in C, and a researcher with works published in protocol engineering and distributed systems conferences -- and not necessarily in that order.
Each experience provides important perspective and innovation to other roles, which I consider critically important to my own career development.
As such, I much prefer roles that permit me to exercise the full scope of my abilities and initiative over narrow, functional roles.

_Emphasizing long-term, strategic impact._

Having performed several roles at a few startups, I do understand the value of iterating quickly to find a product's market fit.
That said, my best work comes through when given the opportunity to solve difficult technical problems and support complex products.
Doing this kind of work means making investments that may take time to show their value and enable new possibilities.

As a final note, autonomy, flexibility and PTO are more important to me than salary.
