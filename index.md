I am a software engineer in the flight software group at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab located outside of Washington, DC. My current projects involve exploring the vulnerabilities of spacecraft to cyber attacks, as well as advancing a model-based approach to spacecraft and UAV fault-management systems. 

Over the past couple years I was involved with DTN as it applies to space networks &mdash; the "Interplanetary Internet" &mdash; and last Fall served as a flight controller during the launch and commissioning of the NASA Van Allen Probes mission.

Recently I started working on a part-time basis with Skyline Innovations, a solar energy startup based in downtown DC.
Specifically, I am designing and implementing a hardware-software system necessary for enabling a new line of business for the company that remotely and reliably measures power-generation from solar installations.
