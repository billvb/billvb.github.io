I spend most of my time in the flight software group at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, where I work on a range of projects involving spaceflight cyber security, autonomous fault-management spacecraft systems, and enterprise process-engineering software.  

Over the past couple years I was involved with DTN as it applies to space networks (the "Interplanetary Internet"), and last spring served as a flight controller in the Mission Operations team for the NASA Van Allen Probes mission.

Recently I took up a position on a part time basis with Skyline Innovations, a renewable energy startup located in downtown DC, where I advise in the design and development of their software infrastructure.

The goal of this website is to serve as a wrapper to my resume, and be a point of visibility for potential colleages, clients, or partners to familiarize themselves with my work and experience.
