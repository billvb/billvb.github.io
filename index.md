I am a software developer near Logan Circle in downtown DC.

I split my time between **Nextility**, a rapidly-growing solar energy startup located in DC, and the spacecraft flight software group at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (**JHUAPL**).

I've developed software or served in the operations team for several NASA space missions, including **Solar Probe**, the **Van Allen Probes**, **EPOXI**, and **Messenger**.
Much of my work at the lab involves research and development of spacecraft fault-management systems, spacecraft cyber penetration testing, and embedded flight software architectures.

Through the years I've contributed to a wide range of efforts; I am equally comfortable writing ANSI C for embedded platforms running VxWorks as I am creating web application in Python and JavaScript.
