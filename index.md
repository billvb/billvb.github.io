Currently I'm the Principal Software Engineer and partner at Gigantum, a DC-based firm developing a product solving major problems in academic data-intensive research. 

I spent almost a decade at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I've worked on a range of efforts including deep-space telecommunications for NASA missions, spacecraft autonomy, and other unmanned aerospace systems.

My principal interest is in taking an innovative new technology out of the lab, maturing it, and delivering it as a hardened, operational product.
