I am a software engineer in Washington, DC.

I split my time between **Nextility**, a rapidly-growing solar energy startup located in DC, and the spacecraft flight software group at the **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab** (JHUAPL).

I've developed software or served in the operations team for several NASA space missions, including **Solar Probe**, the **Van Allen Probes**, **EPOXI**, and **Messenger**.
Much of my work at the lab involves research and development of spacecraft and UAV fault-management systems, spacecraft cyber penetration testing, and embedded flight software architectures.
