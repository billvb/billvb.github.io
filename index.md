I am a software engineer in Washington, DC. My focus is on autonomous systems, cyber security, and embedded applications.

I split my time between **Nextility**, a rapidly-growing energy-services startup located in DC, and the spacecraft flight software group at the **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab** (JHUAPL).

At JHUAPL much of my work has involved the R&amp;D, operations, and analysis of technologies for several NASA space missions.
Over the years these have included Solar Probe, the Van Allen Probes, EPOXI, and Messenger.

I also maintain the website for the annual Workshop on Spacecraft Flight Software [flightsoftware.org](http://flightsoftware.org).
