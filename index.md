I am a multi-disciplinary software engineer living in Washington, DC. Currently I'm a member of the Professional Staff at the JHU Applied Physics Lab and have spent several years in the startup world, where I've worked on a range of efforts including embedded spacecraft software technologies to cloud based business backends.

I spend most of my time in the spacecraft flight software group at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL), where much of my work involves the R&amp;D, operations, and analysis of technologies for several NASA space missions. Over the years these missions have included Solar Probe, the Van Allen Probes, EPOXI, and Messenger. More recently, my research and development efforts have been in safety systems for autonomous aircraft. I've also worked on cyber security issues as pertaining to space flight operations, which has been a very interesting - to say the least.

From 2013 until 2016 I also became a member of the tech team at Nextility, a rapidly-growing energy-services startup located in DC, where I spent a few days each week. My work there included the development of SCADA systems for solar hardware and a framework to collect and normalize daily pricing data from major East Coast gas and electricity utilities, which is one of the key ingredients for enabling its brokerage line-of-business.

Spending time in the startup world and at the Applied Physics Lab has allowed me to foster both depth in technical research, as well as competency in developing and deploying high-quality, business-critical software with deliveries on a quick tempo. In the course of a single week I may one day be working with a team of applied mathematicians to study formal verification for autonomous aircraft behavioral models, and the next day serving as a DevOps engineer writing Ansible playbooks to manage application deployment to a cloud infrastructure.

Informed by almost a decade of experience, it's been my observation that developing software *well* can be immensely gratifying, afford a freedom to focus on the other things important in business and life, and thrive off my peers' creativity.
