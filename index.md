I am a multi-disciplinary software engineer living in Washington, DC. My focus is on autonomous systems, cyber security, and embedded applications.

I spend most of my time in the spacecraft flight software group at the **Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab** (JHUAPL), where much of my work involves the R&amp;D, operations, and analysis of technologies for several NASA space missions. Over the years these missions have included Solar Probe, the Van Allen Probes, EPOXI, and Messenger. More recently my research and development efforts have been in safety systems for autonomous aircraft.

In 2013 I also became a member of the tech team at **Nextility**, a rapidly-growing energy-services startup located in DC, where I spend a few days each week. My work there has included the development of SCADA systems for solar hardware and a framework to collect and normalize daily pricing data from mjaor East Coast gas and electricity utilities, which is one of the key ingredients for enabling our brokerage line-of-business.

Spending time in the startup world and at the Applied Physics Lab has been an excellent opportunity to foster both depth in technical research, as well as competency in developing and deploying high-quality, business-critical software with deliveries on a quick tempo. In the course of a single week I may one day be working with a team of applied mathematicians to study approaches toward formal verification for autonomous aircraft behavioral models, and the next day serving as a DevOps engineer writing Ansible playbooks to manage application deployment to a cloud infrastructure.

A central theme in my career has been in observing and refining how to develop software *well*. Informed by almost a decade of experience, it's been my observation that developing software *well* is personally gratifying, serves as a great way to build friendships and thrive off my peers' creativity, and affords quite a bit of free time to focus on the other things important in business and life. 





I also maintain the website for the annual Workshop on Spacecraft Flight Software [flightsoftware.org](http://flightsoftware.org).
