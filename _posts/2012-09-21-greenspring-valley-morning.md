This past Fall, I have been working on the mission operations team during the comissioning phase of the RBSP mission.
The spacecraft needed monitoring 24/7, and I was caught working the overnight shifts.
Fortunately, my route home took me past some bucolic farms in suburban Baltimore that I noticed looked dramatic as the sun warmed the morning dew.
One day, I made sure to bring my camera along.

It had rained overnight, and the mist was rising over the valley as the sun peaked over the hills.
