### The "Fallacy of Doing Work"

<p class="well well-sm">
<em>Hello</em>.
</p>

Among all the anti-patterns, downward spirals, and aimless trajectories that I've seen software projects and teams assume, there is one particularly pernicious bias that often serves at the enabler.
This bias can affect everyone relating to the effort, from individual developers, to team leads, to program managers and even other observers from within the organization.
I've come to call it the bias - or fallacy - of "doing work".

To many of us "doing work" feels right. 
We feel good about ourselves when we're working and pleased with others when we see them hard at work.
Conversely we feel some degree of shame if we find ourselves in a situation where we could be working, and we most certainly feel a great degree of indignation when we observe that in others.

In fact, we often take a sort of pride in our workloads and humbly boast to our friends and family how busy we are, as if one's busy-ness is a measure of their value or stature.
By contrast, anyone perceived as not being busy may seem a slacker, uninterested in earning money, or simply as being unimportant and hence unworthy of our admiration.

For many industries and types of jobs, the value of constantly having one's nose to the grindstone is clear.
There are more hours billable, more procedures done, more sales pitches pitched... in general, the dividends of the invested effort scale with time and toil dedicated to the task.
Thus this intuition is latent and powerful, and guides our time management and serves to gauge an individual's or team's value.

Annecdotes: Program managers who see their team scrambling and death marching toward a demo as the "A-team",
other members of an organization who regard a developer chronically churning out fixes as heroic,
or regarding someone making drama-free software as not quite pulling their weight. 

In software, the filters: 
Is this work really necessary? 
Is this work only paying the interest on technical debt? (I.e., doesn't advance anything other than allow you to keep holding the balance)
Is this work accidental? (in the sense of accidental complexity - i.e., avoiding a more compact, cheaper, maintainable solution)


The nature of software development, however, is such that the link between doing more work and earning the resulting dividends is far more tenuous.
In developing new software, we are presented
with a blank slate upon which we are free to architect (almost) any solution
that we are intelligent enough to devise.
This empty canvas is a mixed blessing; a well-designed system is limber, friendly
to new developers, and flexible to a changing business environment, but a poorly
designed one locks-in to an aging infrastructures and incurrs a technical debt
in which most subsequent technical effort is expended paying off the interest.

*The Bias*





A fundamental challenge of creating software is to bring the complicated-ness
of the constructed solution as close to it's theoretical lower-bound as possible.
Well-designed and well-constructed software ____.

...

*The bias as manifested by the team lead*

...

*The bias as manifested by the program manager*

...

*The bias as manifested by the observer*

...

*Notes*

* This bias may well occur in other occupations and industries, but I am not close enough to generalize my conclusion here.
