### IOMAXIS, LLC.

###### Senior Software Engineer

*2019 &mdash; present*: Researched and released service providing TCP-like reliability over lossy, one-way network links. Oversaw development and V&V of production-grade implementation in Rust. Published results in the proceedings of the IEEE Aerospace Conference Conference.

Developed protocol for distributed consensus agreement for dynamic route selection in challenging network topology. Prototyped solution, oversaw development of production-grade solution in Rust.

Brought engineering rigor to product development: Distilled customer desires into functional- and performance-requirements; created manual and automated test plans; developed test harnesses in Python to validate system capabilities and benchmark performance.


### Gigantum

###### Lead Platform Engineer

*2017 &mdash; 2019*:
Designed, implemented, tested, deployed, and supported the core Gigantum product back-end to enable reproducible data science. Developed core services in Python accessible via a GraphQL API deployed in Docker containers to customer machines and AWS cloud resources.

Managed, mentored, and trained the QA team. Designed QA processes and oversaw the development of the Selenium-based automated test harness and its integration into the CI pipeline.

Built and maintained relationships with key users and partners. Advocated for the product at conference, workshops, and seminars.


### Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab

###### Principal Investigator, Project Manager, and Professional Staff

*2008 &mdash; 2017*:
Led technical team as Principal Investigator on system supporting the safe testing of autonomy algorithms at flight test ranges. Researched model-based autonomy engines and corresponding approaches to formal verification, trained team to produce high-quality software, successfully passed all engineering milestones, and built excellent relationship with sponsors.

Oversaw development of research and Java-based software prototype for sponsored cooperative, multi-agent fault diagnostics and remediation system as Project Manager. Managed team of post-docs, contractors, and staff to meet milestones and mature technology toward operational capability.

Architected, implemented, and supported cross-mission Command and Data Handling (C&DH) spacecraft flight software. Developed build process using CMake, Bash, and Linux for deployment onto mission-specific hardware platforms, such as Embedded Linux, RTEMS, and VxWorks. Implemented flight software backbone and applications in ANSI C, wrote unit tests, and supported deployment to spacecraft testbeds.


### Nextility

###### Software Engineer

*2013 &mdash; 2016 (Part-time):* Developed, scaled and operated a major software system to enable Nextility's key line-of-business and competitive advantage. This system served to aggregate and normalize the millions of daily power and gas price quotes from dozens of utility companies, and feed them into a front-end for Nextility's customers and partners to ensure they get the lowest possible price for their power and gas service.

Another major effort included the development of a SCADA system for the monitoring, control, metering and diagnostics of solar installations. This involved the development of a full-stack hardware-software solution, from cloud-based backends interfacing over cell networks to embedded components on serial buses.


### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

###### Research Associate

*2007:* Developed hardware serial receiver in VHDL for a laser altimeter instrument.


### University of Mainz Institute for Nuclear Physics

###### National Science Foundation Intern

*2006 (Funded by National Science Foundation):* Developed an application to maintain calibration data for a particle accelerator.


### Education

**M.Sc.**, **B.Sc.** in Computer Science (2010, 2009 George Washington University). Focus in information security.

Fully sponsored 2008-10 under the National Science Foundation Cyber Corps fellowship.
