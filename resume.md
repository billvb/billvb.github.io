### JHU Applied Physics Lab

###### Software Team Lead, Professional Staff

*2008 &mdash; Present:* Research, develop, and integrate novel technologies into NASA space missions, including for purposes of autonomy/safety, networking, and cyber security.

Currently serving as the software team lead on a product for air traffic control to ensure manned and unmanned aircraft (drones) operate safely together in the national airspace. This involves researching inference engines and corresponding approaches to formal verification, developing high-quality, high-reliability software for the safety-critical environment, and bringing the product to operational capacity for air traffic control and flight test managers.

Other ongoing efforts involve advocating for APL's mission-independent spacecraft flight software - specifically to demonstrate its enterprise value and suitability for "operationalizing" off-the-shelf UAV/drone fleets and missions.

Served as a Flight Controller during the launch and commissioning phase of the NASA Van Allen Probes mission. Acquired invaluable experience operating high-profile, mission-critical assets and being part of the multi-disciplinary, 24/7 team of engineers, analysts, and controllers. Prior to serving in this role, I developed software tools in support of the NASA Messenger mission to Mercury.


### Nextility

###### Software Projects Lead

*2013 &mdash; Present (Part-time):* Developed, scaled and operated a major software system to enable Nextility's key line-of-business and competitive advantage. This system served to aggregate and normalize the millions of daily power and gas price quotes from dozens of utility companies, and feed them into a front-end for Nextility's customers and partners to ensure they get the lowest possible price for their power and gas service.

Another major effort included the development of a SCADA system for the monitoring, control, metering and diagnostics of solar installations. This involved the development of a full-stack hardware-software solution, from cloud-based backends interfacing over cell networks to embedded components on serial buses.


### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

###### Research Associate

*2007:* Developed hardware serial receiver in VHDL for a laser altimeter instrument.


### University of Mainz Institute for Nuclear Physics

###### National Science Foundation Intern

*2006 (Funded by National Science Foundation):* Developed an application to maintain calibration data for a particle accelerator.


### Education: George Washington University

**M.Sc.** (2010), **B.Sc.** (2009). Computer Science, focus in info security.

Fully sponsored 2008-10 under the National Science Foundation Cyber Corps fellowship.

### Publications, Skills, etc
