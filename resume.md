### Gigantum

###### Platform Developer and Partner

*2017 &mdash; present*: Design and deliver core services for product accelerating scientific research. Work extensively with partners from major tech companies and academia to deliver high-quality, reproducible results.


### Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab

###### Principal Investigator, Project Manager, and Professional Staff

*2008 &mdash; 2017*: Researched, developed, and integrated novel technologies into NASA space missions, including for purposes of autonomy/safety, networking, and cyber security.

Led software team as Principal Investigator on a product for air traffic control to ensure manned and unmanned aircraft (drones) operate safely together in the national airspace. Researched inference engines and corresponding approaches to formal verification, developed high-quality, high-reliability software for the safety-critical environment, and brought the service to operational capacity for air traffic control and flight test managers.

Served as a Flight Controller during the launch and commissioning phase of the NASA Van Allen Probes mission. Acquired invaluable experience operating high-profile, mission-critical assets and being part of the multi-disciplinary, 24/7 team of engineers, analysts, and controllers. Prior to serving in this role, developed software tools in support of the NASA Messenger mission to Mercury.


### Nextility

###### Software Projects Lead

*2013 &mdash; 2016 (Part-time):* Developed, scaled and operated a major software system to enable Nextility's key line-of-business and competitive advantage. This system served to aggregate and normalize the millions of daily power and gas price quotes from dozens of utility companies, and feed them into a front-end for Nextility's customers and partners to ensure they get the lowest possible price for their power and gas service.

Another major effort included the development of a SCADA system for the monitoring, control, metering and diagnostics of solar installations. This involved the development of a full-stack hardware-software solution, from cloud-based backends interfacing over cell networks to embedded components on serial buses.


### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

###### Research Associate

*2007:* Developed hardware serial receiver in VHDL for a laser altimeter instrument.


### University of Mainz Institute for Nuclear Physics

###### National Science Foundation Intern

*2006 (Funded by National Science Foundation):* Developed an application to maintain calibration data for a particle accelerator.


### Education

**M.Sc.**, **B.Sc.** in Computer Science (2010, 2009 George Washington University). Focus in information security.

Fully sponsored 2008-10 under the National Science Foundation Cyber Corps fellowship.
